# Improved Offline Functionality

Latest version [v1.2](https://github.com/fragtrane/Payday-2-Mods/raw/master/Improved%20Offline%20Functionality/Improved_Offline_Functionality_v1.2.zip).

This mod can also be found on [Mod Workshop](https://modworkshop.net/mod/25511).

## Overview

This mod provides various improvements when playing without an internet connection. Key features and options:

- **Community Content:** Enable community and achievement content when offline. Some community content and achievement-locked content normally require an internet connection to use. This mod saves the state of these community groups/achievements so that you can continue to use this content even when there is no internet connection. The saved state is tied to your Steam ID so multiple accounts on the same computer are tracked separately and will all work properly.
- **Block Inventory Update:** Disable Steam inventory update when offline so that your skins don't disappear. Also suppresses inventory load failed dialog.
- **Offline Filters:** Show filter button in Crime.net Offline so that you can change the difficulty of the contracts that spawn.
- **Offline Chat:** Enable chat in single player mode.
- **No Interaction Interrupt:** Prevent pause menu and chat from interrupting interactions in single player mode.
- **No Armor Regen Bonus:** Disable the armor regeneration bonus in single player mode.
- **Enable Winters:** Allow Captain Winters to spawn in single player mode.
