# Suppressed Raven Admiral Barrel

Latest version [v1.0](https://github.com/fragtrane/Payday-2-Mods/raw/master/Suppressed%20Raven%20Admiral%20Barrel/Suppressed_Raven_Admiral_Barrel_v1.0.zip).

This mod can also be found on [Mod Workshop](https://modworkshop.net/mod/26914).

## Overview

Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyhWtQ63WyQ

This mod turns the Raven Admiral's legendary barrel into a silencer. It does not let you use the barrel without owning the skin. It also does not give any stats that are not possible in the base game.

Key features and options:

- **Silencer Effect for Raven's Legendary Barrel:** The Raven's legendary barrel now has a silencer effect, allowing you to use it in stealth without slapping a suppressor on it and making the gun ridiculously long and ugly. As with all silencers, Dragon's Breath rounds are not allowed.
- **Balanced Stats:** The stats of the legendary barrel are equal to the combined effects of the Short Barrel and The Silent Killer Suppressor. By happy accident, the Optical Illusions aced bug will even give you +3 concealment which is exactly what you would get if you were using The Silent Killer Suppressor. So stats-wise, it is completely identical to a vanilla stealth Raven. The gadget perk of the legendary barrel is retained, meaning you can use a laser by default. This is not doing anything that isn't already possible in the base game, since the Compact Laser Module also gives a laser with no concealment penalty.
- **OSA/SDSS Integration:** Both [Optional Skin Attachments](https://github.com/fragtrane/Payday-2-Mods/tree/master/Optional%20Skin%20Attachments) and [Super Duper Skin Swapper](https://github.com/fragtrane/Payday-2-Mods/tree/master/Super%20Duper%20Skin%20Swapper) have the option to display legendary weapon mods in the weapon modification menu. If you are using the Suppressed Raven Admiral Barrel mod, the name of the legendary barrel will be changed to "Admiral Suppressed Barrel".

## Host/Client Interactions

This mod has been tested both as client and host with vanilla and modded peers.

- The silencer effect works both as client and host. Guards will not be alerted, so you can safely use it in stealth.
- The gunshot sound is only suppressed for players who have the mod. Any gunshot from a Raven Admiral Barrel will sound suppressed to a modded player. So if an unmodded player in your lobby is using a Raven Admiral, their gunshots will sound suppressed for you while they are in fact loud (and will alert guards).
- Players who do not have the mod will hear a loud gunshot. This may be confusing for them because they will hear a loud gunshot but won't see guards being alerted.
- Similarly, you will see a silencer icon in the loadout screen next to any player with a Raven Admiral Barrel equipped, regardless of whether or not they have the mod.
- Unmodded players will not see a silencer icon in the loadout screen.
