# Normal Hold for Bernetti Auto and Czech 92 (WIP)

Latest version [v0.2](https://github.com/fragtrane/Payday-2-Mods/raw/master/Normal%20Hold%20for%20Bernetti%20Auto%20and%20Czech%2092/Normal_Hold_for_Bernetti_Auto_and_Czech_92_v0.2.zip).

## Overview

Demo (Bernetti Auto): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3NDrSQLgEk

Changes the Bernetti Auto and Czech 92 so that the the gun is held with both hands on the grip instead of one hand on the foregrip/front magazine. Uses the 5/7 AP's animations because it works the best. With other pistol animations, the magazine will appear to be floating during the reload. This is much less apparent with 5/7 AP's animations and may not even be visible depending on your FOV settings.

## Known Issues

The reload sound is silent when the application is first launched. You need to equip a 5/7 AP and join a game. Afterwards, you can leave and the reload sound will work until you exit the application. This is because [some sounds don't play until the original weapon has been loaded into memory](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/1055533-post3.html?s=ff1847d9a1c1b61c568822c76cdef7a0).

I have already tried changing the reload using mod_overrides instead, but that just makes the reload permamently silent.
