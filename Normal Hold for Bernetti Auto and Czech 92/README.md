# Normal Hold for Bernetti Auto and Czech 92 (WIP)

Latest version [v0.1](https://github.com/fragtrane/Payday-2-Mods/raw/master/Normal%20Hold%20for%20Bernetti%20Auto%20and%20Czech%2092/Normal_Hold_for_Bernetti_Auto_and_Czech_92_v0.1.zip).

## Overview

Demo (Bernetti Auto): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3NDrSQLgEk

Changes the Bernetti Auto and Czech 92 so that the the gun is held with both hands on the grip instead of the foregrip/front magazine. Uses the 5/7 AP's animations because it works the best. With other pistol animations, the magazine will appear to be floating during the reload. This is much less apparent with 5/7 AP's animations and may not even be noticeable depending on your FOV settings.

## Known Issues

- Reload sound is silent at first. You need to equip a 5/7 AP and join a game. Afterwards, you can leave and the reload sound will work until you close your game. I do not know how to fix this.
- Sight attachments are slightly misaligned (iron sights work fine though). Can't be bothered to look into fixing this rigth now since sights on pistols look terrible anyways.
