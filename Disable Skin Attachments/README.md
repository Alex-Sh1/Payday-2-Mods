# Disable Skin Attachments

Latest version [v1.0](https://github.com/fragtrane/Payday-2-Mods/raw/master/Disable%20Skin%20Attachments/Disable_Skin_Attachments_v1.0.zip).

Note: you may want to consider using my [Optional Skin Attachments](https://github.com/fragtrane/Payday-2-Mods/tree/master/Optional%20Skin%20Attachments) mod, which allows you to choose which attachments you want to use instead of completely disabling them. Optional Skin Attachments is not compatible with Disable Skin Attachments, so only install one of them.

## Overview

This mod removes weapon attachments from weapon skins and allows legendary weapon skins to be unlocked. Key features and options:

- **No False-Positive Cheater Tags:** Using a weapon mod from a DLC that you don't own is programmed to trigger a cheater tag, and most legendary attachments are also programmed to trigger a cheater tag. This normally gets overrided because the game checks that the attachment is included in the skin that you are using. When a mod removes the attachments associated with a skin, this can lead to false-positive cheater tags if the check is not updated. This issue has been resolved in this mod.
- **Fix Common/Uncommon Skins:** Fix common and uncommon weapon skins that remove attachments for no reason.
- **Remove Attachments:** Remove attachments from weapon skins (rare, epic, and non-locked legendary skins).
- **Rename Legendary Skins:** Allow legendary weapon skins to be renamed.
- **Customize Legendary Skins:** Unlock legendary weapon skins so that they can be customized.
- **Remove Unlocked Legendary Attachments:** Remove attachments from unlocked legendary weapon skins.
- **Remove Legendary Attachment Stats:** Remove stats from legendary weapon attachments.

Please note that this mod completely removes attachments from skins, so the attachments will not appear as "available" when the skin is applied. This may be a problem if you don't have certain weapon attachments in stock or if you don't own all the DLCs. If you want to have more control over weapon attachments instead of just completely disabling them, consider using my [Optional Skin Attachments](https://github.com/fragtrane/Payday-2-Mods/tree/master/Optional%20Skin%20Attachments) mod instead.
