# ECM Timer

Latest version [v1.0](https://github.com/fragtrane/Payday-2-Mods/raw/master/ECM%20Timer/ECM_Timer_v1.0.zip).

This mod can also be found on [Mod Workshop](https://modworkshop.net/mod/25509).

Note: the code used in this mod was not written by me. I have only ported it to BLT and made a few small changes.

## Overview

Key features and options:

- **ECM Timer:** Adds an ECM timer to the HUD when an ECM is active. If multiple ECMs are active, the longest duration is used. No distinction is made between basic and pager-blocking ECMs. Pocket ECMs are not displayed.

## Installation

This mod requires [SuperBLT](https://superblt.znix.xyz) for automatic updates.

This is a BLT mod. Download [`ECM_Timer_v1.0.zip`](https://github.com/fragtrane/Payday-2-Mods/raw/master/ECM%20Timer/ECM_Timer_v1.0.zip) and extract the entire contents to your `mods` folder.

The location of the `mods` folder depends on where you installed the game; typically it can be found here:

```

```

## Acknowledgments

The code was written by LazyOzzy originally and can be found [here](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/payday-2-a/122868-ecm-duration-timer.html). I have ported it to BLT and made a few adjustments to the icon and counter.
