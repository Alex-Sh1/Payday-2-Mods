Latest version [v1.2](https://github.com/fragtrane/Payday-2-Mods/raw/master/Optional%20Skin%20Attachments/Optional_Skin_Attachments_v1.2.zip).

This mod can also be found on [Mod Workshop](https://modworkshop.net/mydownloads.php?action=view_down&did=25474).

## Overview

A video demo of this mod can be found on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMdNRZA4hpw).

This mod allows you to choose which attachments to use when applying weapon skins and provides improved support for legendary skins. Key features and options:

- **Choose Skin Attachments:** Replaces the apply/remove skin confirmation dialog with a menu that allows you to choose which attachments to use. You can choose to keep your current attachments, use the attachments on the new skin, or remove all attachments. If you are using the Gage Shotgun Pack 000 Buckshot unlocked by your skin and you remove the skin and choose to keep your attachments, the mod will automatically use the free 000 Buckshot if you do not own the Gage Shotgun Pack DLC. This mod also fixes skins that don't actually have attachments included.
- **Autobuy Missing Mods:** Automatically buy missing weapon attachments using Continental coins when you choose to keep your current attachments.
- **Autobuy Threshold:** Do not let Continental coins drop below this threshold when autobuying (range 0 to 200).
- **Prefer Shotgun Pack Buckshot:** Give the Gage Shotgun Pack 000 Buckshot priority when applying skins. When skins are applied or removed, the free 000 Buckshot will be replaced by the Gage Shotgun Pack 000 Buckshot if you own the Gage Shotgun Pack DLC.
- **Save Mods On Missing Skins:** Try to keep attachments when skins are removed from Steam inventory.
- **Choose Attachments in Previews:** Enable dialog menu for choosing attachments when previewing weapon skins.
- **Optional Boosts:** Adds option to choose whether or not to apply stat boosts.
- **Disable All Boosts:** Stops all skin stat boosts from being applied to weapons.
- **Rename Legendary Skins:** Allow legendary skins to be renamed.
- **Customize Legendary Skins:** Allow legendary skins to be unlocked so that they can be customized.
- **Remove Legendary Mod Stats:** Remove stats from legendary weapon attachments.
- **Show Legendary Mods:** Show legendary weapon attachments in weapon customization menu so that they can be selected. Can be set to only show mods from owned legendary skins.
