# Item Hunter

Latest version [v1.0](https://github.com/fragtrane/Payday-2-Mods/raw/master/Item%20Hunter/Item_Hunter_v1.0.zip).

This mod can also be found on [Mod Workshop](https://modworkshop.net/mydownloads.php?action=view_down&did=26200).

## Overview

This mod adds waypoints to items for collectible achievements/trophies. The mod is activated via a keybind and can be toggled on/off. Note that for some objectives, the waypoints will not automatically disappear, so just toggle off the mod when you're done. This typically happens for achievements where you have to shoot some static object on the map.
